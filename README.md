# Team Generator
---
## Description
Upon running the application, prompts are given to enter details about your team manager, any engineers in your team, and any interns in your team.  Once all the team members have been entered, it will generate an HTML file with team cards for each member.  A video walk-through can be seen at the following link: https://watch.screencastify.com/v/PfszpNfFR24PhjKID5Ce.
